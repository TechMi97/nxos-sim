/*
   As described in nxt-native from Sivan Toledo:

   The NXT firmware recognizes a native file by the
   string "NXTBINARY" at the beginning of the file.
   To keep the changes in the NXT's firmware minimal,
   the file name must be .rxe (same as the stadard
   NXT binaries which are for a virtual machine).

   When the NXT's firmware recognizes a native file,
   it calls a function at offset X in the file, where
   X is the 32-bit number stored in offset 12 in the file.
   The firmware passes two arguments to the function: the
   address of the file in flash, and the length of the file.

     * The firmware expects to see at offset 12 in the
     * file the offset of the entry function from the
     * firmware. It evaluates to 80 (16-byte header
     * plus 64 bytes of vectors).
