1. Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

NxOS is an open source operating system that runs on the Lego Mindstorms NXT
platform. It aims at providing a comprehensive base system that provides
easy-to-use APIs to the NXT's hardware, including sensors, display and motors.

It also contains some libraries that developers of /application kernels/ may find
of some interest, such as a file system or a GUI builder.

NxOS is written in C, and must be cross-compiled to the ARM platform. See section 2
below for the building requirements.


2. Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Building and testing NxOS requires a few softwares and libraries. Since most of
the external utilities are written in Python, you will need a working installation
of Python (www.python.org). You will also need libusb and the python-pyusb packages,
needed by PyNXT to upload an NxOS kernel to the brick.

  * Python >= 2.4
  * libusb
  * python-pyusb
  * PyBluez (if you want to upload/boot from the enhanced fw using bluetooth)

You will also need a working ARM cross-compilation chain. To ease
the process, you will find in the scripts/ directory an automatic
fetcher/builder :

  % mkdir -p ~/arm-gcc/
  % cd $_
  % ~/where/is/nxos/scripts/build-arm-toolchain.sh
  [...]

Don't forget to add ~/arm-gcc/install/bin to your PATH environment variable.

For MacOS X (>= 10.5.x) users, don't forget to install the Lego
driver Leopard update from the Lego software updates page, or you
won't be able to communicate with the brick via USB.

3. Building and testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build NxOS, simply go inside the nxos/ subdirectory (the one
that contains base/, systems/, ...) and type:

  % scons appkernels=tests

Finally, connect the brick to your computer with the USB cable, and do:

  % ./boot_firmware

The script will then ask you for the kernel to upload, and then upload the
firmware to the brick's RAM, ROM (flash) or to RAM of the enhanced
NXT-standard-firmware from John Hansen (available where brikcc is available).

To upload using RAM (kernel_samba.bin) or flash (kernel_rom.bin) the NXT must
be in SAMBA-mode, which is achieved pressing the button in the hole below the
USB-port (using a LEGO-antenna or such). To upload to the enhanced firmware
(kernel.rxe), you have to install the enhanced firmware from John Hansens. This
gives the advantage that the NxOS-kernel is stored like any other program on
the NXT and you can still use NXT-G, NBC witout the need to reflash the
firmware. The disadvantage is, that you will have less RAM available for your
program, because the program is started in RAM (as when you are uploading a
kernel_samba.bin).

To build and try another kernel, simply replace 'tests' by the name
of the application kernel you want to build. The available kernels
are the directory in systems/. You can also build several appkernels at
once by using a comma-separated list. Once scons is called with appkernel=xyz,
you only have to invoke scons without any arguments, because the options to
scons are stored in a file namend scons.options.
