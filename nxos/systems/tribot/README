These are several basic programs to test different functions with the Tribot.
The examples use the Behavior-Based Robotics Paradigm in its implementation.

Currently, the following behaviors are implemented:
linefollower - Line Following
grasper - Object Grasping + linefollower behaviors
mover - Object Moving + grasper behaviors
tribot - Obstacle Avoidance + mover behaiors

Build using appkernels=tribot/<projectname>
